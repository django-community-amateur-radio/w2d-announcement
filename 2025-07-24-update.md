Only a few days remain on the Special Event W2D in honor of Django's 20th birthday.

Last weekend an activation was done through the Parks on the Air program from a wildlife refuge in Kansas, making 95 contacts in a couple of hours on site. There are a lot of radio operators who like to hunt parks through this program. For those of us who see amateur radio as a tool in the wake of natural disasters, it's good practice to set up your equipment in a place you've never seen before.

Three of us have managed 852 contacts with 42 geopolitical entities and a fifth continent. We've been looked up 5,779 times.

If you're interested and a radio operator - contact AF0G via QRZ or open an issue on https://github.com/django-community-amateur-radio/w2d-announcement/blob/main/README.md
