# W2D Special Event Station announcement

Amateur radio operators or those interested who also use Django - special event callsign W2D has been reserved to celebrate Django's 20th birthday.

This can be an opportunity to operate a special event callsign, which many other hams chase, and spread the word of our framework. Any legal modes/bands allowed, within the restrictions of your license class (the callsign does not extend your frequency privileges). No specific experience is required in order to participate.

A QRZ page (the de facto "phone book" of amateur radio) will be set up with info on Django, its birthday, and we would love to share use cases within the hobby using the framework - please send those details to us.

Django's code of conduct applies to on air operation.

If you're interested, get in touch with Adam Fast on the Django Discord, DjangoCon US Slack, 

This event is not sponsored or organized by the Django Software Foundation as an official activity. It is organized by the community for their own enjoyment of radio operating.



# More Details

#### When will the event take place?

W2D is assigned from Saturday, July 12th through Saturday, July 26th. Many events start at the UTC date change, so Friday evening US time things could start.

When we operate will depend on each individual's availability, but we expect to be evening and weekend heavy.

#### What's a Special Event Station?

Amateur Radio operators are issued "call signs" or a series of numbers and letters that uniquely identify them (much as I remember the station ID WGBH from PBS-produced videos in my childhood)

The FCC also allows operators to reserve "special event call signs" which are two letters and one number for a number of purposes. "Hams" use these call signs to activate on the air and allow others to participate. Currently (early July) an event known as "13 colonies" is going on - hams from within the 13 colonies activate as K2A through K2M and other hams "hunt" to find them for a commemorative certificate. Other large profile events are Route 66 On the Air (from locations along Route 66), 12 Days of Christmas, and many others.

Special Events give radio operators a "reason" to either activate for others to find them, or to search out the activators.

#### How can I find an activator?

[PSKreporter](https://pskreporter.info/pskmap?callsign=W2D&search=Find) is a good start as FT8/FT4 is definitely planned, but [Reverse Beacon Network](https://www.reversebeacon.net/main.php?rows=100&max_age=10,hours&spotted_call=W2D&hide=distance_km) regular spotting networks could be helpful for any voice or morse code operating (for instance, the Django Powered [DXHeat](https://dxheat.com/db/W2D/))

#### Will there be a certificate?

Yes, it will be possible to get a W2D commemmorative certificate afterward.

#### Can SWLs participate?

SWLs (short-wave listeners, those who enjoy listening but either aren't licensed amateurs to transmit, or choose not to) can ask for a certificate as well if they wish. Give us a short log of what you're hearing, the UTC time/date and frequency and we'll confirm your reception of our signals as long as they compare with our logs.

#### How is Django used in Amateur Radio?

The site [DXHeat](https://www.dxheat.com) is powered by Django [reference](https://dh1tw.de/dxheat-com-is-online/).

If you know of others, please let us know about them to update the list!

#### What is Amateur Radio?

It's easier to say it's not like being a DJ of your own music station, but aside from that you can choose your own adventure whether that be "chasing DX" (trying to make contact with distant countries), communicating locally with friends and family, experimenting with building your own equipment, or many other sub-hobbies. The American Radio Relay League can provide more info https://www.arrl.org/what-is-ham-radio

#### I'd like to get licensed

There is still time to get a license or upgrade to a higher class (many testing groups can do exam sessions via videoconference.) if you need info on becoming licensed, please reach out as well. 

#### What about non-US stations?

Participation is limited to those with US FCC licenses, the rules do not seem to allow holders of other licenses to operate the special event callsign even though reciprocal agreements would allow operation under your own call from the US. RemoteHamRadio suggests https://vea.org.au for remote testing for an FCC license if you are in another country but would have remote access to a transceiver in the US.
