# W2D Django 20th Celebration Continues

Nearing one week in, two operators of the W2D special event station honoring Django's 20th birthday have made over 400 contacts with 22 geopolitical entities on 4 continents. Over 3,000 have looked us up on QRZ, a "phone book" of radio operators. Over 2400 of those lookups were in the first two days of operating (when the bulk of contacts occurred). 

Things have slowed down with the workweek and day to day responsibilities but an activation through Parks on the Air for Support Your Parks Weekend is planned and should draw additional radio traffic. 

Thanks for the help and support of the Django community, those with amateur radio licenses and those without in getting out the word.

If you're interested and a radio operator - contact AF0G via QRZ or open an issue on https://github.com/django-community-amateur-radio/w2d-announcement/blob/main/README.md
