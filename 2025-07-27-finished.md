# W2D Special Event Completion

This evening we wrapped up operation with W2D, the special event callsign issued to celebrate the Django Web Framework's 20th birthday.

Thank you to all the amateur radio operators who worked us or at some point we worked you. 

Three Django Community members managed 1,026 contacts with 47 geopolitical entities and five continents. We were looked up 5,779 times on QRZ.

Thank you to the W2D operator team who made the special event possible, and thank you to the Django Software Foundation and its members who make the Django Web Framework and its community possible.

Certificates will be available shortly. Unsurprisingly, there's a Django app that powers them, but no ADIF database backend exists yet so there's some work to translate everything across. I will update QRZ with the link when it is available as well as contact those who have reached out to ask for them.
